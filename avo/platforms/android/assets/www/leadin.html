	<h1>The <span style="font-style: italics">Juicy</span> Details&hellip;</h1>
	<p id="notrealjuice">The truth about your &ldquo;orange juice&comma;&rdquo; and fruit juice in general&comma; is that it&rsquo;s not real juice&comma; even the 100&percnt; types&period; Fruits are seasonal&period; Even though they can still be bought year&hyphen;round&comma; it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re going to taste good year&hyphen;round&period; Which is why fruits are processed&mdash;causing all fiber content to be removed&mdash; and then the subsequent liquid is stored in huge tanks&comma; where they keep for a year&period; When it comes time to actually package the juice&comma; ethyl butyrate is added&comma; or as I like to call it&comma; &ldquo;Magical Packets of Flavor&period;&rdquo; While it hasn&rsquo;t been linked to health dangers&comma; yet&comma; wasn&rsquo;t your juice supposed to be 100&percnt;&quest; This packet gives juice the distinctive fruity flavor. Perhaps the most important thing for you to remeber is to drink real juice&period; Fruit juice&comma; unless it was literally squeezed in front of your eyes&comma; is not going to be healthy for you. Processed fruit juice is just another way for you to load up on sugar, without any of the useful nutrients&period;</p>
